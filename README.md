# react-scaffold
## Simple scaffold for React apps

This is a simple scaffolding project for React apps that does not include the complexity of create-react-app. 

### Purpose
I wanted a quick way to start a React app with webpack, babel and express without having the bloat of create-react-app.

### Usage
1. Clone repo 
2. Change directory to the new myReactProject directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm build` to run webpack
5. Run `npm start`
6. Navigate in your browser to http://localhost:3000

### Example
```javascript 
git clone https://github.com/bergerinc/react-scaffold.git myReactProject
cd myReactProject
npm i
npm run build
npm start
```
